The codes have been tested under Win7+VS2010.
 
The graphic card I am using is ATI Radeon HD 3400 Series.

Solution file (Project 2.sln) and project files (.vcproj) are included to build the projects.

The datasets and button images are passed to the applications through command line in the following order.

"MRI.exe" "full path of axial<N>.vtk" "full path of MRI_continuous.png" "full path of MRI_discrete.png"

"Altitude.exe" "full path of westUS.vtk" "full path of WestUS_1.PNG" "full path of WestUS_2.PNG" "full path of WestUS_3.PNG" "full path of WestUS_4.PNG"
