The codes have been tested under Win7+VS2010.
 
The graphic card I am using is ATI Radeon HD 3400 Series.

Solution file ("Task1and2.sln" is the main one) and project files (.vcproj) are included to build the projects.

The datasets are passed to the applications through command line in the following order.

"Task1and2.exe" "full path of original CT dataset"

"Task3.exe" "full path of gradient magnitude dataset"
 
"Task4.exe" "full path of original CT dataset" "full path of the corresponding gradient magnitude dataset" 

"Task5.exe" "full path of original CT dataset"

"Task6.exe" "full path of original CT dataset"
